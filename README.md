# memeasm
This is a collection of example programs for [MemeAssembly](https://github.com/kammt/MemeAssembly), an esoteric x86-Assembly based programming language. Just for fun :)

### Programs
* [to_binary](to_binary/to_binary.memeasm): Prints the binary digits of a number that is set in the code itself.

### How to run
So you want to run some of these programs?

First, make sure you have MemeAssembly installed.

Then go into a program directory (e.g. `to_binary`) using 

    cd to_binary

Now you can use `make` to build & run the program:

    make run

This builds and runs the program.
